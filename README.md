SwissSniffer is just the fancy names of the tools that I created. I completed the Courses on Udemy - Learn Python and Ethical Hacking together by Zaid. That Course is Actually very benifical for me as I learned python in Different way. I learn concepts like List, Dictionary, Threading, OOPS, Functions, Regex all these stuff when I need them for the Task.

That was an intresting course As with python I also Learn the Indepth working of several Hacking Tools which comes built in Kali Linux and parrot os and can be in other distro's as well. 

There is the Problem with the course that the content was a bit old. So I need to apply some of my concepts to make the things works. So Here some of the Programs are in Python 3 and Some of them are In python2.

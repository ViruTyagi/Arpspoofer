SwissSniffer is just the fancy names of the tools that I created. I completed the Courses on Udemy - Learn Python and Ethical Hacking together by Zaid. That Course is Actually very benifical for me as I learned python in Different way. I learn concepts like List, Dictionary, Threading, OOPS, Functions, Regex all these stuff when I need them for the Task.

That was an intresting course As with python I also Learn the Indepth working of several Hacking Tools which comes built in Kali Linux and parrot os and can be in other distro's as well. 

There is the Problem with the course that the content was a bit old. So I need to apply some of my concepts to make the things works. So Here some of the Programs are in Python 3 and Some of them are In python2. 
** You have all the rights. If you can modify them and make it more easy to use for the people** 

1. Mac_changer -- Machine 
This is the simple tool and it just change the Mac address of the computer for the current session. Obviously after restarting the computer it is going to reset to the actual one. So what is the advantage of this -- well if someone blocked your mac-address from the network or from anysite. You can change the mac adress and easily access the stuff. Well you need to care for few things like you have to change the mac address to some genuine ones otherwise your internet is not going to work. 

It runs few comands in the linux terminal by using a package called subprocess what it does that takes input in python program and execute it in terminal and then return the ouput to the screen very benifical for the hacking tasks.
